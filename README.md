## Overview

Welcome to the **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** repository! This project leverages **Power BI** to transform raw road accident data into interactive and actionable insights aimed at enhancing road safety. By visualizing various aspects of road accidents, this dashboard assists stakeholders in identifying patterns, high-risk areas, and critical factors contributing to accidents, thereby facilitating informed decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Features

- **Accident Severity by Casualties** üö®  
  Analyzes factors contributing to accident severity, including the number and extent of casualties, helping identify areas for targeted interventions.

- **Casualty Insights by Road Type & Vehicle Type** üõ£Ô∏èüöó  
  Highlights high-risk areas such as urban roads and prioritizes safety measures for vulnerable road users like cyclists and motorcyclists.

- **Temporal & Environmental Trends** üìÖüå¶Ô∏è  
  Reveals potential increases in casualties during specific months and daylight hours, suggesting seasonal and behavioral factors affecting road safety.

- **Geographical Visualization** üó∫Ô∏è  
  Utilizes interactive maps to pinpoint accident hotspots and allows filtering by weather conditions and road surfaces for comprehensive risk assessment.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** üìà  
  Displays primary KPIs like total casualties and accident severity with year-over-year growth, alongside secondary KPIs such as casualties by vehicle type.

- **Interactive Filters & Slicers** üîç  
  Enables users to customize views based on date ranges, locations, accident types, and more for a tailored analysis experience.

## Key Findings

1. **Accident Severity by Casualties**  
   Identified key factors that escalate accident severity, providing insights into necessary safety interventions to reduce severe outcomes.

2. **Casualty Distribution by Road and Vehicle Types**  
   Determined that urban roads have higher accident rates, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in these areas. Vulnerable road users like cyclists are particularly at risk.

3. **Temporal Trends**  
   Observed a potential increase in casualties during April and May, likely influenced by seasonal factors. Higher casualty rates during daylight hours suggest the need for focused driver behavior studies.

4. **Geographical Hotspots**  
   Mapped accident-prone areas, enabling targeted safety improvements and resource allocation to high-risk locations.

  For data visualization and dashboard creation.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
  For advanced calculations and data manipulation.

- **Power Query**  
  For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

## Installation

To view and interact with the **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-accident-analysis-dashboard.git
```

### 2. Open the Power BI File

Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.pbix` file using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure that Power BI Desktop is updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.
