## Overview

Welcome to the **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** repository! This project leverages **Power BI** to transform raw road accident data into interactive and actionable insights aimed at enhancing road safety. By visualizing various aspects of road accidents, this dashboard assists stakeholders in identifying patterns, high-risk areas, and critical factors contributing to accidents, thereby facilitating informed decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Features

- 🚨 **Accident Severity by Casualties**  
  Analyzes factors contributing to accident severity, including the number and extent of casualties, helping identify areas for targeted interventions.

- 🛣️🚗 **Casualty Insights by Road Type & Vehicle Type**   
  Highlights high-risk areas such as urban roads and prioritizes safety measures for vulnerable road users like cyclists and motorcyclists.

- 📅🌦️ **Temporal & Environmental Trends** 
  Reveals potential increases in casualties during specific months and daylight hours, suggesting seasonal and behavioral factors affecting road safety.

- 🗺️ **Geographical Visualization**  
  Utilizes interactive maps to pinpoint accident hotspots and allows filtering by weather conditions and road surfaces for comprehensive risk assessment.

- 📈 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
  Displays primary KPIs like total casualties and accident severity with year-over-year growth, alongside secondary KPIs such as casualties by vehicle type.

- 🔍 **Interactive Filters & Slicers**  
  Enables users to customize views based on date ranges, locations, accident types, and more for a tailored analysis experience.

## Key Findings

1. **Accident Severity by Casualties**  
   Identified key factors that escalate accident severity, providing insights into necessary safety interventions to reduce severe outcomes.

2. **Casualty Distribution by Road and Vehicle Types**  
   Determined that urban roads have higher accident rates, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in these areas. Vulnerable road users like cyclists are particularly at risk.

3. **Temporal Trends**  
   Observed a potential increase in casualties during April and May, likely influenced by seasonal factors. Higher casualty rates during daylight hours suggest the need for focused driver behavior studies.

4. **Geographical Hotspots**  
   Mapped accident-prone areas, enabling targeted safety improvements and resource allocation to high-risk locations.

## Data Sources

- The data used in this project is included in the [Data](https://github.com/MansouriAli-1/Road_Accident_Analysis_Dashboard/tree/main/Data) folder.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**  
  For data visualization and dashboard creation.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
  For advanced calculations and data manipulation.

- **Power Query**  
  For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

## Installation

To view and interact with the **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-accident-analysis-dashboard.git
```

### 2. Open the Power BI File

Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.pbix` file using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure that Power BI Desktop is updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

### 4. Load Data

If you need to use your own data, replace the sample datasets with your data sources. Ensure that the data schema matches the expected format.

## Usage

Once you have the dashboard open in Power BI Desktop:

1. **Explore the Visuals**  
   Navigate through different pages of the dashboard to explore various insights.

2. **Interact with Filters**  
   Use the filter pane to customize the data view based on specific criteria such as date range, location, or accident type.

3. **Analyze Insights**  
   Utilize the interactive charts, maps, and tables to analyze trends, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights.

4. **Export Reports**  
   Export the reports to PDF or PowerPoint for presentations or further analysis.


## Key Findings

- **Seasonal Patterns:** Increased accident rates observed in April and May.
- **High-Risk Areas:** Urban roads exhibit higher casualty rates.
- **Vulnerable Users:** Cyclists and motorcyclists are significantly affected.
- **Daylight Hours:** Higher accidents during daylight suggest behavioral factors at play.
